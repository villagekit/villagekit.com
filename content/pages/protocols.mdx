# Village Kit: Protocols

A protocol is a clear description of a reusable and interoperable building block.

We are developing open source protocols for every facet of living infrastructure, where each protocol focuses on making one thing more friendly.

Our hypothesis is that a few top-down standardized interfaces will best support bottom-up stigmergic ecosystems.

## Protocols

With an initial focus on living, the relevant systems include:

- Physical
  - Construction
    - [Grid Beam](https://gridbeam.xyz)
  - Energy
  - Heat
  - Fluids
- Socio-economic
  - Ownership
  - Stewardship

More information will arise as we make progress with our prototypes, stay tuned.
