# Village Kit: Systems

Our goal is to enable an ecosystem of reusable and interoperable building blocks necessary to sustain life.

Our hypothesis is that top-down standardized interfaces will best support bottom-up stigmergic ecosystems.

## Modular Systems

We aim to design and prototype friendly systems for every facet of living infrastructure.

With an initial focus on housing, the relevant systems include:

- Construction
- Energy
- Heat
- Fluids
- ...

We also design social and economic systems for how groups can sustainably live together.
