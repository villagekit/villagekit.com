# Village Kit: Systems

Our goal is to enable an ecosystem of reusable and interoperable building blocks necessary to sustain life.

Our hypothesis is that well-targeted top-down constraints will support bottom-up micro-utpoias.

## Modular Systems

We aim to design and prototype friendly systems for every facet of living infrastructure:

- Construction
- Energy
- Insulation
- Plumbing
- ...

We also design social and economic systems for how groups can sustainably live together.
