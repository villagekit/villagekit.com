# Village Kit: Patterns

A pattern is a clear description of a reusable and interoperable building block.

We are developing open source patterns for every facet of living infrastructure, where each pattern focuses on making one thing more friendly.

Our hypothesis is that a few top-down standardized interfaces will best support bottom-up stigmergic ecosystems.

## Patterns

With an initial focus on living, the relevant systems include:

- Physical
  - Construction
  - Energy
  - Heat
  - Fluids
- Socio-economic
  - Ownership
  - Stewardship

More information will arise as we make progress with our prototypes, stay tuned.

<!--

Below are some rough notes:

### Construction

[Grid Beam](https://gridbeam.xyz)

- beams
- panels
- clamps
- hinges

### Energy

- connectors
  - USB C
  - [Wago](https://www.wago.com/)
  - [ring terminals](https://www.mcmaster.com/ring-terminals/)
- conversion
  - USB C allows the power sink to negotiate voltage with power source
    - an improvement over using DC-to-DC buck or boost converters
- transfer: wires

### Heat

- conversion
  - heat pump
    - [air source heat pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_source_heat_pumps
    - [ground source heat pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_heat_pump)
- distribution
  - hot water bottles
  - underfloor heating
  - radiator
- transfer
  - as fluid

### Fluids

- transfer
  - pipes

### Ownership

- shares in a company
- trustees in a trust

### Stewardship

- defined work responsibilities
- advice process
