# Village Kit

Village Kit is a platform for open source, modular living infrastructure to evolve with us.

We want to enable an ecosystem of reusable and interoperable building blocks necessary to sustain life.

## Principles

- Support the general movement with specific prototypes
- Support well-engineered, modular, interoperable, and re-usable construction systems
  - As a trade-off with bespoke upcycling that is not modular, interoperable, or re-usable
  - For example: [Grid Beam](https://gridbeam.xyz/), [structural pipe fittings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pipe_fitting), [T-Slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-slot_structural_framing)
- Use code-based [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) where possible
  - For example: [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) or [OpenJSCAD](https://openjscad.org/)
- Enable open sharing of fractal (macro and micro) designs
  - Such as a [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) (e.g. [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/)) for physcial modules
- Accumulating re-usable construction materials should be a viable economic savings strategy
- Less unconstrained macro-utopias (as they continue to fail), more constrained pragmatic business plans and clear boundaries to support micro-utopias
  - For example: an #ecovillage requires too much upfront privilege, the whole system is dependent on self-actualizing visions, and there are unmitigated risk when conflicts inevitably arise
  - Another example: the Burning Man org (and regional burn orgs) is actually authoritarian, but the authority is very limited in scope (e.g. where you are allowed to camp), which enables each camp to be their own anarchist micro-utopia
